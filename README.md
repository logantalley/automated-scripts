# automated-scripts
h1. header_footer.sh
This script will remove all headers and footers from multiple files within the same directory as the script and then add the header and footer to the whole file. It's very useful for staging files that must be combined.

h1. no_footer.sh
This script will do the same as above, but will not add a footer
